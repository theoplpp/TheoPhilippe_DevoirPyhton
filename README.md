In this project, we needed to follow several step: 
-
  First we needed to study the dataset to have a good understanding of it. Hence, complete our study of the dataset by several vizualisations. 
After these steps, we can modelize the dataset with several algorithms. Then we can achieve our final goal whixh is the building of a prediction API. 

What have I learn from this project:
-
  I have learn a lot of vizualisation technics, furthermore I learned that without vizualisation, it is impossible to predict all correlations
between variables. However, the fact that we predict web users behavior was quiete satisfying.
